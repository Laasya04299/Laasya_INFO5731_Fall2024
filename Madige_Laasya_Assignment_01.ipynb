I took a lot of time for the last question as it invloved the CSV file where I need to read the data and interpret accordingly. There is no complaint on time as it was sufficient for the assignment. I have nothing to suggest as I was confortable and happy with this assignment. Overall, It was a good assigment to learn and brush my coding skills. I liked the transition in difficluty level and It was a great learning experience."
